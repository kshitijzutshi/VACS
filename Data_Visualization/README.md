## Data Visualization Recipe  

Types of Visualization (The why?)
* Explanatory (Communicate something to a larger audience)  
* Exploratory (Find out interesting aspects/patterns in the data) 
* Confirmatory (Visual evidence for an assertion/hypothesis)  

Check the data! GIGO (Garbage-in, garbage-out)
* Missing values?
* Data types (Categorical, Nominal, Ordinal, Numeric, Strings, Dates)
* Data type attributes (GPS, Sequence/Time-series, Nodes/Edges)
* Data structure (Tabular, Graph, Time-series, Hierarchical, Geographic, Map, Network, etc.)
* Data type semantics (Spatial, Temporal)
* Outliers?
* Enough data (Power)?
* Is the data stationary?
* Is the data biased?


Fix data issues and log what was done
* Impute missing values  
* Remove outliers  
* Adjust for bias 
* Upsample
* Create synthetic data 

Feature selection 
* Which features are important?
* Entropy/information of each feature  
* Partial dependencies/marginal contributions of each feature    
* Relations between the features  
* Dependencies between the features  

Scale, normalize and transform
* When to scale?
* When to normalize?
* When to transform?

Graphical components
* X-position  
* Y - position  
* Color  
* Marks - Shape (Points, Bars,Lines, Areas, Volumes)  
* Channels (Position, Size, Angle/Slope, Color/Intensity/Hue,Texture)
* Animation    
* Faceting (small multiples) 


Chart types and fundamental graphs   
* Bar chart  (Categorical versus numeric)  
* Scatter plot (Numeric versus numeric)  
* Line graphs (Sequence versus numeric) 
* Matrix (Rows versus columns)  
* Maps (Transformation)

Legends, Labels, Annotations, and Typeface  
* How to design and choose legends, labels, annotations and type   


Visual cognitive effectiveness   
* Quality of Data    
* Accuracy   
* Discriminability    
* Salience    
* Clutter  
* Grouping  


 
 
## Data Visualization Design

A collection of data visualization chart choosers, reference guides, cheat sheets, websites, books, tutorials and infographics about data visualization design.


*The Data Visualisation Catalogue* 

The Data Visualisation Catalogue   [https://datavizcatalogue.com](https://datavizcatalogue.com)  

The Data Visualisation Catalogue is a project developed by [http://www.severinoribecca.one](Severino Ribecca) to create a library of different information visualisation types. The website serves as a learning and inspiration resource for those working with data visualisation.
